        <h1>Part 2: How to Play a Barre Chords</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="First-Step">
        <h1>1. Getting your Finger Position Correct</h1>
        <p>When practicing barre chords, use the stronger part of your finger near the thumb, rather than the softer, squishy area. To get used to the pressure required, place your middle finger over your index finger. This will help you feel the amount of pressure needed to press the strings properly, and with practice, you'll develop the necessary muscle memory.</p>
        <img src="Images/Barre1.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Second-Step">
        <h1>2. Press your Thumb against the back of the neck</h1>
        <p>Think of holding your fingers on the guitar neck as if you're squishing a bug. Apply pressure from both sides of the neck to achieve the clearest sound. It might feel awkward at first, but with practice, it will become more natural.</p>
        <img src= "Images/Barre2.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Third-Step">
        <h1>3. Begin a practice routine</h1>
        <p>Spend 10–15 minutes daily practicing just your index finger across the any fret. Pluck or strum each string to ensure you get a clear sound from each one.</p>
        <img src= "Images/Barre3.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Fourth-Step">
        <h1>4. Practice holding this position while moving between frets</h1>
        <p>Keep in mind that the farther you move from the neck, the lower the string tension becomes, making it slightly easier to press down and hold the barre.</p>
        <img src= "Images/Barre4.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Fifth-Step">
        <h1>5. Apply Chord Shapes</h1>
        <p>Focus on strengthening your index finger into a solid barre before adding other fingers to form full chords.</p>
        <img src= "Images/Barre5.png">

        <h1>Set of Barre Chords to Practice</h1>
        <img src="Images/Barrechords.png">
        <p>Focus on mastering these barre chords: F, B, Bm, and C#m. These chords will help you build strength and precision in your fretting hand. Practice holding the barre firmly and adding the remaining fingers to form each chord shape. Spend time transitioning between these chords to improve your fluency and build muscle memory.</p>

        <h2>Training your fingers</h2>

      </div>

      <div class="Inst1">
        <h1>1. Position your hands over the strings of your guitar.</h1>
        <h2>Before learning fingerpicking patterns, familiarize yourself with your hand's position over the strings. Rest your thumb on the sixth string, your index finger on the third string, your middle finger on the second string, and your ring finger on the first string.</h2>
        <img src="Images/Fingername.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Inst2">
        <h1>2. Curve all segments of your fingers</h1>
        <h2>Your fingers have three joints, and each should maintain a slight curve, as if you're holding an apple or tennis ball in your palm. Keep your wrist and fingers relaxed for better control and comfort.</h2>
        <img src="Images/Finger1.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Inst3">
        <h1>3. Curl your finger towards your palm to pick a string. </h1>
        <h2>For fingerpicking, move your fingers by swinging them toward your palm, using only the base knuckle for movement. Practice this motion with your thumb and the first three fingers individually.</h2>
        <img src="Images/Finger2.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Inst4">
        <h1>4. Move your thumb from the base joint.</h1>
        <h2>Your thumb, like your fingers, has 3 joints. You can feel the base joint near your wrist by bending your thumb inward toward your palm. This base joint provides the strength and power for your thumb's movement.</h2>
        <img src="Images/Finger3.png">
      </div>

      <div class="Inst5">
        <h1>5. Try basic fingerpicking exercises.</h1>
        <h2>Fingerpicking exercises help your fingers move independently and prepare you for patterns. Even simple strumming with focus on finger movement can be effective—you don’t need specialized exercises to get started.</h2>
        <p>For example, you can practice fingerpicking a G chord followed by a C chord. Play the lowest note of the chord with your thumb, the next lowest with your first finger, next with your second finger, and highest note with your third finger.</p>

        <h1>6. Fingerpicking with Chords</h1>
        <h2>You’re now practicing fingerpicking with the chords G, Em, C, and D using the same fingerpicking pattern. The only adjustment is the position of your thumb:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="chord">G:</span> The thumb plucks the 6th string.</li>
            <li><span class="chord">Em:</span> The thumb plucks the 5th string.</li>

        <p>Learning "Night Changes" by One Direction and "Payphone" by Maroon 5 is a great way to practice barre chords like F#m, Bm, C#m, and F. Both songs feature smooth chord progressions that challenge your transitions while helping you build strength and accuracy. Their moderate tempo allows you to focus on clean sound and consistent strumming or fingerpicking. Perfect for improving barre chord technique!</p>
