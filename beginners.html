        <div class="guitar-part">
            <h2>Tuning Pegs</h2>
            <p>Small knobs on the headstock that you turn to tighten or loosen each string, adjusting its pitch.</p>

        <div class="guitar-part">
            <h2>Frets</h2>
            <p>Thin metal strips spaced along the fretboard. Each fret represents a different note, with smaller intervals as you move up the neck.</p>

            <p>Located on the body of the guitar, this part holds the strings in place and transfers their vibrations to the body. Acoustic guitars may have a saddle on the bridge, while electric guitars often have saddles for each string.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify the Pegs:</strong> Each string has its own tuning peg. Typically, pegs are aligned on the headstock in a way that matches the order of the strings (E-A-D-G-B-E).</li>
                
                <li><strong>Tightening and Loosening:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tighten (Turn Peg Clockwise):</strong> Raises the pitch of the string.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loosen (Turn Peg Counterclockwise):</strong> Lowers the pitch of the string.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a tuner to check the string’s pitch. Pluck the string, watch the tuner, and slowly turn the peg until it reaches the target note.</li>
                        <li>For more precision, turn the peg in small increments to avoid overshooting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Final Check:</strong> Once all strings are tuned, play a few chords to confirm they sound correct together. Re-tune if needed, as adjusting one string can slightly impact others.</li>

        <h1>Part 3: How to Read Chords</h1>
        <section class="Chordsdescription">
        <p>Chord diagrams help you understand where to place your fingers on the fretboard. Here’s how to read them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chord Diagram:</strong> A chord diagram is a visual representation of the guitar neck. The vertical lines represent the strings (left to right: low E to high E). The horizontal lines represent the frets.</li>
        <li><strong>Dots:</strong> Dots on the diagram indicate where to press your fingers down on the fretboard.
            <ul>
                <li>If the dot is on the first horizontal line, you press the string down at the first fret.</li>
                <li>If it’s on the second line, you press the string at the second fret, and so on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Open Strings:</strong> If a string is marked with an "O", you play that string without pressing it down (an open string).</li>

            <h2>Proper Finger Position</h2>
            <p>Use the pads of your fingers, not the tips, to press down the strings. Keep your fingers as close to the fret as possible without being on top of it.</p>
            <h2>Avoid Muting Strings</h2>
            <p>Be mindful of your other fingers not accidentally muting adjacent strings. For example, when pressing a chord, your fingers should arch enough to avoid touching other strings unintentionally.</p>
            <h2>Pressure</h2>
            <p>Apply enough pressure to get a clean sound, but not too much that it makes the strings buzz.</p>

        <h2>1. Hold the Guitar Properly</h2>
        <p>To hold the guitar correctly, sit up straight with the guitar body resting on your thigh (left thigh for classical position, right for casual). Angle the neck slightly upward. Use your strumming arm to lightly press the guitar body against you, keeping it stable. Your fretting hand should be relaxed and positioned to move freely along the neck without holding up the guitar.</p>

        <h2>6. Strumming with a Pattern along with a G chord</h2>
        <p>To play the strumming pattern of “down, down, up, up, down, down”, start by forming the G chord. Begin with two downstrokes, strumming all the strings. Follow with two light upstrokes, then another downstroke, and finish with one last downstroke. Keep your wrist relaxed and stay consistent with the rhythm to create a smooth, flowing sound.</p>
